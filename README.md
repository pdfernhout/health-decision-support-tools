# health-decision-support-tools

Tools to support people collaboratively making health decisions, especially decisions involving uncertainties and conflicts of interests

## License: Apache 2.0

## Memorial Dedication

This project is in memory of two people who pioneered collaborative decision support tools in what they each saw to be the public interest and who sadly both died young from health issues:

* Al Selvin, who co-invented the [Compendium software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compendium_%28software%29) and died unexpectedly of heart failure at age 56 while bicycling
* Tom Armour, who managed [DARPA's Genoa project](https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/genoaII.php) and died of brain cancer at age 58

The project's long-term goals are to:
* Gather ideas from various ["tribes" of intelligence](http://p2pfoundation.net/Tribes_of_intelligence) such as Academic, Civil Society (including religions and labor unions), Commerce, Government (including local and state), Law Enforcement, Media, Military, and Non-Government/Non-Profit.
* Apply those ideas by creating software tools to help individuals and small groups collaboratively make difficult health (or other) decisions in the face of uncertainties and conflicts of interests. Those decisions might be about prevention of health issues (as might have helped Al and his family) or they might be about responses to emerging health issues (as might have helped Tom and his family after his initial diagnosis).

# Initial Audience

In the very long term, it would be fantastic if health decision support tools could support people of all sorts of backgrounds, educational levels, and skills. It would be amazing if the tools could adapt themselves to different user skill levels. It would be fabulous if such tools could tutor users in facilitating health sensemaking and decision making. It would be wonderful if the tools could flag problematical usage situations automatically and escalate them for collective review or other advanced interventions. It would be terrific if such a project defined international machine-readable semantic standards for encoding and indexing open source health information (as needed) and used such standards to encode and index all of the enormous body of existing health literature and related discussions of it for easy access and review by anyone anywhere. No doubt this wish list could be added to further. However, those are not realistic initial aspirations for all sorts of practical reasons. Such aspirations likely may never be fully achievable goals -- even if they can be guiding stars.

A more realistic initial aspiration is to create tools usable by small groups led by someone with the equivalent of a graduate education in medicine, science, engineering, or social work -- someone who already understands the scientific method and/or how communities process knowledge and conflicts of interests. This lead user would take responsibility for ensuring the ongoing collaboration goes well despite obstacles. Such lead users would in turn facilitate sensemaking and decision making by a family or team who might have less education and less skill than the team lead (but who still, initially, all have some reasonable degree of computer and other decision making skills and also some health-related background knowledge themselves). As Al Selvin discussed in his PhD thesis and other writings, facilitators (he called them practitioners) can help guide participants in creating representations of issues or ideas, such as collaborative diagrams. Currently, this facilitative process still requires practitioners have multiple skills. So, another initial requirement then for the initial software lead users is that they have such facilitative skills or are working diligently to acquire them in a setting with appropriate supervision and feedback.

What are examples of the intended initial lead users of such health decision support tools, given a high level of expectations for education and skills of initial users of these tools? An initial lead user might be someone who is already a health care professional and who is facilitating health decisions for their own parents alongside siblings with various opinions (which is a tricky situation, but one that such professionals are often asked to involve themselves in where the normal provider-patient relationship does not apply). Another example might be a person with a graduate degree in biology who has already read a variety of health-related books written from a variety of perspectives and who is supporting their own family in thinking through conflicting opinions and options from primary care physicians, specialists, and other health information sources such as about a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet. Another possible initial lead user might be a skilled and experienced social worker who is helping coordinate care for someone in a nursing home by helping that person and their family collect and reconcile multiple opinions and options supplied from different specialists and interested parties in different areas of care who may each use their own vocabularies and perspectives (such as physical therapy, religious support, psychologists, family members, primary care physicians, nursing staff, nutritionists, recreational therapists, health aids, friends, and individual personal preferences). Other initial users might be experienced health researchers who are using these tools as part of their own collaborative research process into some specific health issue of interest based on the scientific literature and perhaps even their own scientific laboratory research.

In all these cases, it is also assumed the primary lead user of the initial software would already have a significant level of skill with both computers and health information, even as other people in the group they are facilitating (people who might interact with the software at the request of the lead user) might have a lesser degree of such skills.

It seems reasonable to predict that future versions of the tools could lower the amount of computer skills to use them by better software design. It is harder to predict whether the requirements of a lead users for skills in facilitation, the scientific method, or accessing health knowledge could be lowered any time soon.

## Initial Example

Heart disease and cancer are such complex and emotional topics they are hard to start with as motivational examples. They are just overwhelming for anyone to deal with. So, here is a simpler [initial example of a health issue](initial-health-issue-example.md) (involving a tooth ache) that the initial project committer faced and used Compendium to help make sense of and help make decisions about.
