# health-decision-support-tools

Tools to support people collaboratively making health decisions, especially decisions involving uncertainties and conflicts of interests

## Memorial dedication

This project is in memory of two people who pioneered decision support tools in what they each saw to be the public interest and who sadly both died young from health issues:

* Al Selvin, who co-invented the [Compendium software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compendium_%28software%29) and died unexpectedly of heart failure at age 56 while bicycling
* Tom Armour, who managed [DARPA's Genoa project](https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/genoaII.php) and died of brain cancer at age 58

The project's long-term goals are to:
* Gather ideas from various ["tribes" of intelligence](http://p2pfoundation.net/Tribes_of_intelligence) such as Academic, Civil Society (including religions and labor unions), Commerce, Government (including local and state), Law Enforcement, Media, Military, and Non-Government/Non-Profit.
* Apply those ideas by creating software tools to help individuals and small groups collaboratively make difficult health (or other) decisions in the face of uncertainties and conflicts of interests. Those decisions might be about prevention of health issues (as might have helped Al and his family) or they might be about responses to emerging health issues (as might have helped Tom and his family after his intial diagnosis).
